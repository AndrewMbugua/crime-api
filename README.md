The United Kingdom’s Police API serves as a crucial resource for open government
initiatives, by providing comprehensive access to data on past criminal activities. With this
API, users can access data on crimes reported by police, thus promoting transparency and
accountability in law enforcement efforts. Additionally, the API enables location-based crime
tracking, empowering government agencies to monitor specific areas and identify trends in
criminal behaviour.


In the realm of open government API’s, the UK Police API plays a pivotal role in enhancing
public safety and trust. By integrating this API into government systems, authorities can
efficiently access crime data and identify locations associated with criminal activities. This
integration strengthens the government's ability to respond effectively to security threats and
uphold the rule of law. Furthermore, incorporating the API into open government frameworks
fosters collaboration and information sharing among agencies and community organizations,
leading to more coordinated and proactive security measures.

While no comparable API is currently available in Kenya, this Hackathon aims to explore the
potential of such a system in advancing open government API’s. To facilitate this
exploration, Liquid Intelligent Technologies has developed a mock API resembling the UK
Police API, which participants can use to prototype innovative solutions. Inspired by the
structure of the official API and its documentation, this mock API provides participants with a
platform to develop effective strategies for leveraging open government data in enhancing
security. The provided mock API also provides the ability to submit a crime report/incident,
something that is not available in the official UK Police API. It is envisioned that such
functionality would not replace the standard process for lodging a complaint of criminal
activity, but instead could be used as a less formal way to track crimes, identify patterns and
alert users before they enter a crime hotspot.
